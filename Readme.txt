# Hey friend,
#            This is surya, If you've just set up your google cloud account and have made an instance in it and are logging in through console's terminal and are wondering # on how to login through a ssh client like git bash or something, you are at the right place :) All you gotta do is first login through your termainal clone this repo of # mine ( git clone https://github.com/AyrusWalker/Googlecloud.git ) on your machine run the setup file (./setup_user.sh) which I created here and wohoo! you'll have a new # user with a password for your VM 
#  NOTE: Don't forget to edit the script in the setup file (setup_user.sh) and change the username and password according to your requirements or else you'll have user     #  with the name and password which i wrote in default. Happy coding :)
