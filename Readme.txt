 Hey friend,
            This is surya, If you've just set up your google cloud account and have made an instance in it and are logging in through console's terminal and are wondering  on how to login through a ssh client like git bash or something, you are at the right place :) All you gotta do is first login through your termainal clone this repo of  mine ( git clone https://github.com/AyrusWalker/Googlecloud.git ) on your machine run the setup file (./setup-user.sh) which I created here and wohoo! you'll have a new  user with a password for your VM 
  
NOTE: Don't forget to edit the script in the setup file (setup-user.sh) and change the username and password according to your requirements or else you'll have user       with the name and password which i wrote in default and then run the command ( chmod 777 setup-user.sh ) to make the file executable. (If you are cloning the repo then you might not need to change the permissions but if you are copying the code of the setup file then you need to run the command ) Happy coding :)
